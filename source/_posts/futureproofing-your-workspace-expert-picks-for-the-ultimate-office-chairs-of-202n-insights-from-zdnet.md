## Futureproofing Your Workspace: Expert Picks for the Ultimate Office Chairs of 202N | Insights From ZDNet

Choosing the best office chair is really subjective when looking at office furniture. Not everyone wants the same chair since not everyone works the same. Some people prioritize being adjustable arms or seat depth, while others want something high-end that looks striking behind their desk. Then there are people who focus on price -- either they want the cheapest, best value chair out there, or they want the creme de la creme, and that's where our list comes in handy. 

We've hand-picked 10 office chairs that will satisfy a range of wants and needs -- whether you work from home or are back in a regular office. We believe these picks are among the best office chairs you can buy right now.

[Herman Miller Aeron Chair Best office chair overall](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB01N0ZUN15%3FlinkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26tag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C59ff97a5-b8d0-4e71-997c-35c4afad086e%7Cdtp&dtb=1) 

Herman Miller

**Features:** 350 pound weight capacity | 6 color options | 3 size options

The Aeron is another chair from Herman Miller. It's our choice for the absolute best office chair because it's completely customizable. Choose what size you want, the type of back support, the tilt, if you want adjustable arms or not, and your chair's caster. The Aeron uses an "8Z Pellicle elastomeric" suspension to create zones that run across the chair to make sure your body feels totally supported. This unique backing also allows body heat to pass through the chair, so you're comfortable in warmer climates or during the summer months. 

While it comes at a hefty price tag, it's worth it since your chair will be exactly what you want/need. 

**Pros:** 

* Completely customizable
* Patented PostureFit SL back support
* Made of recycled materials

**Cons:**

* Expensive--and customizations can add up

## How did we choose these office chairs?

We chose these office chairs through rigorous research, and some of our team even used the products themselves. We compared factors like pricing, reviews (both good and bad), different features that make each chair stand out, and the support that each chair provides. 

## What to look for in an office chair?

As we said before, everyone will want something different in an office chair, but there are a few key features that you should look for that every chair should have. 

**Lumbar support:** An office chair with included lumbar support will prevent back pain/tension since it properly aligns your muscles and spine with its contoured shape. Lumbar support can also improve your posture.

**Adjustable features:** Features like adjustable armrests, adjustable height, and adjustable lumbar support are important for an office chair to have so you can customize the chair to your needs and your office setup. 

**Cushioned seat:** Be sure your office chair has a well-cushioned seat since that's the part of the chair where you will be putting most of your weight on. Look for a deeper seat if you are taller, and a shallower seat if you're on the shorter side. Also look out for chairs with waterfall seats, which are designed to slope slightly downward to relieve the pressure on the back of your thighs and knees. 

**Caster wheels:** You should be able to easily move around your office space thanks to quality caster wheels on your office chair. Pay attention to what type of floor(s) a manufacturer says the office chair is ideal for.

## Are expensive office chairs worth it?

Even though the price of some of these chairs may be sticker shock, an expensive office chair is worth it since you sit in it at least eight hours a day. There's nothing worse than being sore after sitting in an uncomfortable chair (not to mention, it can hinder your productivity), so investing in a quality office chair is important for your office setup.

## What is the best ergonomic office chair?

The best ergonomic office chair is the Steelcase Leap Fabric Office Chair since it has lower back tension controls and a contoured backrest that adjusts to your sitting position.

## How do you make an office chair more comfortable?

If the office chair you buy ends up not being the most comfortable, there are ways to fix that. For example, you can buy an office chair seat cushion to add more support and comfort. There are all different types of seat cushions that will fit any chair. 

In addition, you can add a lumbar support pillow to your office chair if it is lacking in that area. There are actually lumbar support pillows specifically made for office chairs, so you'll have plenty to choose from.

## Exporting Your Teachable Live Classes Into Common File Formats: A Step-by-Step Guide

### Overview

As a student or a graduate who wants to learn some knowledge or improve some skill, Teachable is a good choice. On Teachable you may find many excellent online courses and want to learn them all, but due to the slow bandwidth speed or limited spare time, many users have the need to download the Teachable online courses for offline learning. However, many users have given the feedback that downloading the Teachable courses is not an easy job, even if for the subscription members. So many users have asked if there is another method to download the Teachable courses.

I go to Teachable official website and find that it is true that the downloading feature is not included in Teachable subscription features, although many other useful features are included. But do not feel frustrated, and the following article just shares a functional Teachable downloader - Allavsoft to help users with the Teachable course downloading job.

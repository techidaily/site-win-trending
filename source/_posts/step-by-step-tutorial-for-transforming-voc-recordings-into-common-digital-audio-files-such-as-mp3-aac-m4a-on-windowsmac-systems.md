### How to Deal With VOC Conversion or Playback?

At present, there are two approaches to solve these problems:

**1\. Download a VOC player**

After searching on the internet, we finally make the conclusion that a VOC player is usually not available.

The second method seems easier to do, but a powerful and reliable tool is not that easy to get. We usually download some apps, only to find they can not convert VOC, or the app is hard to handle, or the operation steps are too complex to follow.

### Brief Introduction of VOC

VOC was created by Creative Labs (famous in audio field)--which is the first one to bring audio card to PC. VOC, composed by two parts: header block and data block was applied by sound blaster as the audio format. It originally spread widely with the common use of DOS system, even once became the standard audio format. However, with the born and development of Windows system, which provides a new format-- WAV as its standard audio format and doesn't apply VOC directly, VOC gradually became inferior. Excluded by Windows system brings disaster for VOC as well as users. This terrible phenomenon results in the fact that VOC can't be opened in most audio player like Windows Media Player.
